# Platons

**Platons** are 3D shapes made of overlapping Platonic solids and their
derivatives. They can be used as 3D avatars or in demo scenes instead of cubes
and spheres. This repository contains an online tool to generate
platons and save them as images, 3D models or web pages with Three.js code.
